                Here are five reasons to donate to charity:
                1. To help others.
                First and foremost, when you contribute to a cause you are making the world a better place. Whether you are donating your time, money or expertise, there are recipient(s) benefiting from it. People may go to school because of the scholarship you fund, children may feel supported by the shelter or food they receive, animals may be saved because of the organization you donate too, and society’s carbon footprint may decrease as a result of your research and efforts. Ultimately, giving back shows kindness and those around you see that. 
                While sometimes there are questions about where money goes in the public sector, the fact is, everyone in it is trying to do something bigger than what one of us could do alone. The fact is this: when you donate to charity you are doing good in the world.Donations are forms of gifts. They are voluntarily given without any requirements or strings attached, and it doesn’t require anything in return. It’s up to the receiver to use what is given or may dispose of it when he or she does not need it.”
                This is incorrect. Donations can be Restricted or Unrestricted. Unrestricted can be used for any purpose, however Restricted MUST be used for the purpose they are given. It is a serious offence to use Restricted funds outside the requirements of the donor. If the Restrictions cannot be met, the funds must be returned to the donor or new permission obtained to use them for a different purpose.Donations and grants are forms of giving something like cash, services, and goods that can be a benefit for people who are in need.
                A donation is given by anyone usually for charitable purposes and to benefit a cause while grants are funds given by a specific party, particularly the government, corporations, foundations, educational institutions, businesses, or an individual.

                What does bettering the world lead to? Feeling good! The act of helping others, donating to charity, or volunteering your time, will give you an improved sense of wellbeing.<br> 
                The knowledge that you’ve sacrificed time and/or money in order to help others in need or create positive change in the world is a beautiful thing. Receiving notice of the good your money has done in a certain community, or a letter from your foster child, can truly warm your heart.<br>
                Giving to charity can give you a sense of purpose in life, along with self worth and inner satisfaction.

              <p>When you are considering making a charitable donation, you will most likely want to research what cause you’d like to support, the organizations that can best achieve this, and the structure and mission of those organizations. As a result of this research, you become more educated about social injustices around the world.<br>
              Furthermore, you’ll be exposed to new perspectives and opinions on topics about which you were previously uninformed. This is important for a lot of reasons, such as gaining a greater understanding of the world and your own community.<br>
              Exposure to various topics can also fuel your sense of purpose in life and contribute to solutions and a greater world.
